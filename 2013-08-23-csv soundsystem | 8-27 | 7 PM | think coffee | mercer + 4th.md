I'm waiting for hadoop
Twenty-six TBs to compute
Spun up the servers, 125 
Praying to god that my script stays alive 
I'm waiting for hadoop

Hey, twitter, what links are going around?
Hey, pitchfork, what's the newest sound?
Oh pardon me sir, let me switch my tabs
just taking a break while amazon does math
I'm waiting for hadoop

what's for lunch? I think I need a snack
Mexican spot on 48th ave.
I'm gonna get the same thing as before
First thing you learn is to order al pastor
I'm waiting for hadoop

Back to the office, up three flights of stairs 
tweet fit bit progress, but nobody cares 
check the admin, get a quick update
only halfway there, I got more time to waste 
I'm waiting for hadoop

the console hollers, it starts to bawl and shout 
Runtime Error, how'm I gonna work it  out?
but I'm feeling good cause it's a quarter to five
Come tomorrow I'll just change a couple lines
I'm waiting for hadoop
