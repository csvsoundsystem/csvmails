We'll be meeting tomorrow (tuesday the 4th) at 7pm at Whynot Coffee & Wine in the West Village in the downstairs Jazz room.

Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whynot-coffee-and-wine-new-york

They have two locations so be careful not to end up in the east village.

Join us, won't you?

This week, Hall & Oates in their classic 1981 single "-u Makes Upstreams Push True", about the joy in setting your remote branch so you don't have to waste time specifying branches later on.

What I want -u's got
And it might need t'auth my handle
Avoid the [shame that's wearing sandals](http://csvsoundsystem.us3.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=93591895dc074a74bb7667416&id=4e84c72f98&e=f649fb7443)
The sandal shells of shame
Yeah, yeah,
What I've got's full blocks
Of naughts and streams my chatter
Then you push them all together
And how I now explain
Oh, yeah
Well, well -u
(Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
-u makes upstreams push true
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)
Well, well, well -u
(-u-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
Oh, yeah
-u makes upstreams push true
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)

On a night when a bad branch becomes a screamer
Merges messin' with the vimmer
I can laugh it in the face
:wq and ! my way out
And wrap a flag around me
'Cos origins don't confound me
And it'll always be the same
Oh, yeah
Well, 'cos -u
(Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
-u makes upstreams push true
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)
Well, well, well -u
(-u-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
-u makes upstreams push true
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)

Listen to this

I'm pushing to this stream
Oh, those objects should be counted by now
I know
'Bout -u
Well, ye-aahh
-u makes upstreams push true
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)
Oh, yeah
I've waited for, waited for -u git
(-u-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
Oh, yeah
-u makes upstreams push true
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)
-u and me, -u and me...
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)
I've waited for, waited for -u git
-u makes upstreams push true
Oh
Oh-oh
I've waited for, waited for, waited for, waited for, waited for, waited for
-u makes my dreams
I've been waiting for -u git
