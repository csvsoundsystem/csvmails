From now on, Michael and I will only send out our invitations in rhymed verse. This week, a limerick:

huzzah! huzzah! another CSV!
join us, won't you? for quiche and tea.
      all the bugs in your code
      will most surely explode,
and i might finally learn ruby.


In other news, I (Brian) will be leaving my job soon at Harmony Institute and I'm looking for a replacement.  Check out the attached job description and share with your nerdy friends. Thanks!
