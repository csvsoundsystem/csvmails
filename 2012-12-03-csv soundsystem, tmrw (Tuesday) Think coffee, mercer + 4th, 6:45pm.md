Push it to delimit.
Split along the comma's edge,
but don't look down, just parse the line
until its finished.

Open up, delimit.
Past the point of carriage return 
You've maxed your ram but still you gotta learn 
how to skim it.

Hit the spinning wheel from double line breaks
rows wide open like a bat out of hell 
and you crash IE8
(crash IE8)

Welcome to delimit
