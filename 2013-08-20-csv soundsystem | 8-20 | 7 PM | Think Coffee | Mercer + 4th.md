This week, "Can I Git It?" by A Tribe Called Quest.  After this we promise to make no more git-related puns in weekly poems.

Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Can I git it? (Yes you can!)
Now it's spawned (Go on then!)

Can I git it? To all the coders open sourcin' like Ashkenas
before this, did you know what git log was?
comprehend to the repo and its changes
git status; check local behaviors
git pull; make sure you're updated
rebase when you're into shit major
submit an issue if you see a really lame bug
pull request if you're into doing favors
merge conflict livin is the bain of
a life filled with commits, that's what i love
a lower branch is what master's above
git diff; find edits you don't think of
git merge; like a push but a big shove,
use the GUI if you're down with the Cocoa Puff,
don't matter so long as you push, love
now your code's in the cloud like a dove
