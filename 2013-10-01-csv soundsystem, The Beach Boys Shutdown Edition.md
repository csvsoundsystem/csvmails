Tech it up, tech it up

Buddy gonna shut you down

It happened at CSV, where power outlets are few
(Oooo rev it up now)
Two cool laptops standing side-by-side
(Oooo rev it up now)
Yeah, my Ruby-injected Macbook and a Windows PC

(Oooo rev it up now)
Revvin' up our if-then loops and it sounds real mean
(Oooo rev it up now)

Tech it up, tech it up, tech it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

Declinin' counters at an even rate
(Oooo movin' out now)
At the count of one we both run our scripts
(Oooo movin' out now)
My Macbook’s light the mouse pointer’s starting to spin
(Oooo movin' out now)
But the IRb is ready to go
Oooo movin' out now)

Gotta be cool now counter variable here we go

The PC running Python is windin' out in low
But my Ruby-injected Mac’s really startin' to go
To get the traction I'm defining my own math functions
The power plug’s burnin' that machine's too much

Command prompts running, watch the code fly by
(Oooo pump it up now)
And now PC’s lead is startin' to shrink
(Oooo pump it up now)
He's hot with his break and continue statements but it's understood
(Oooo pump it up now)
I got a Ruby-injected Macbook sittin' under my hood
(Oooo pump it up now)

Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
