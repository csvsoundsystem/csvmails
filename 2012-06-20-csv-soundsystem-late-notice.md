So Brian Abelson, Marc Georges and I are starting an informal meetup
where if you have a project you're working on you can bring it and be
around other people who are working on things and we can answer
questions/share knowledge and things.

We like csvs and often listen to lcd soundsystem while working on them
so we're calling it csv soundsystem. much inspiration from
@bigdatahipster. Brian's work may give us some money to make it a
formal meetup group but until then we're using the low-cost
alternative of email.

We decided to start it this evening at Think Coffee on Mercer near
washington square. 4th I think? Come at 6:45. Wednesday seems like a good day so
we'll try and do it next wednesday too. Why Think Coffee? There's a
lot of room and wifi. If someone else knows a place feel free to
suggest.

Come to learn, come to work, come to drink a bunch of tea. Invite whomever
