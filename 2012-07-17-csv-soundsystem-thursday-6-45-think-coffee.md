I think a bunch of people are going to see Duncan Watts speak tomorrow night at [Secret Science Club](http://secretscienceclub.blogspot.com/), so we're gonna do CSV on Thursday.  

Michael are working on our endless stream of SQF projects.  This time we're making the first ever "map to the editor" in response to [this fluorescence](http://project.wnyc.org/stop-frisk-guns/).  I might also be working on scaping the entirety of imdb. fun!
