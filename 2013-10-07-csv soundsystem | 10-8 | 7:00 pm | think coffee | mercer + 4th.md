Hi friends of the comma,

Last week our musical arm played its first show in San Francisco.  Much fun was had and primitive cpu keyboards were broken.  Watch the highlights in this video made by the amazing Lam Thuy Vo: http://vimeo.com/76190871.

This week, 'Man in the Middle' by Michael Jackson (AKA @aubergene)

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a diff
Gonna make it right

As I, turn off the trust in
My proxy from Blue Coat
This algo is monitoring my mind
I see the kids on their phone
With not enough unix
Who am I to be teaching bind?
Pretending not to see their needs

LulzSec disregard, a tin foil hat top
And a one man Snowden
They follow each other on Twitter ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the middle
I'm encrypting to evade his gaze
And no message will ever be sent clear text
If you want to make the net a safer place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of web
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no HTTPS, not a DNS to own
Could it be really me, pretending they're not tracking?

A web of trust deeply scared, Stallman's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern worse is better ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with HTTP

I'm starting with the man in the middle
I'm encrypting to evade his gaze
And no message will ever be sent clear text
If you want to make the net a safer place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the middle
I'm encrypting to evade his gaze
And no message will ever be sent clear text
If you want to make the net a safer place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that
Change!
