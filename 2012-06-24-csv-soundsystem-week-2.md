Last week a few of us got together to work on some coding stuff after work. It was fun so we're gonna do it again. Maybe every Wednesday and we're calling it csv soundsystem because it seems appropriate. Last week i worked on some underscore.js and brian showed us how he makes awesome comment boxes in R â€” everyone was really impressed by it.

If you're down for week two, we're gonna be at think coffe on mercer and 4th starting at 6:45 cause they have tables, wifi, good coffee according to marc georges and soup.
