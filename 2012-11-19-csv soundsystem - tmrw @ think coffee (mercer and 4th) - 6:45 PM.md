Hey all,

After some weather and work-related setbacks, CSV will resume its regularly scheduled programming (pun intended).  I hope you can all join us tomorrow night for some hacky fun!

oh, and heres a haiku for your thoughts.

ponder lonely divs
like so many downtrod doors
who will close them all?
