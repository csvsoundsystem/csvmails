[Hook]
I run codes
[I geo-code]
In different map projections
CODES! In different map projections

[Verse 1 - Ludagis]
Now you thought I was just ED50 & WGS-84?


I'm worldwide, act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable lo-cation
Globe address resolving post man
QGIS/PostGIS pope, man
NAV-D 88's and Beidou-2
I send small cities and states geo-planning tools.


Luzon 19-11, matter fact - VL 19-15
I'll grab the GPS, we can find POI’s
So control your map points and digitize on
Til I close these shapes up and extract polygons
IGN62, IGN63 (oh), IRENET95, NAND-8-tree's (oh)


Check your geo-loc and watch for geocode ‘urrz
WMS on one port; these tiles is self serve
ETRS-89, JGD -’00, my OSM overloads

[hook]

[Nate Dogg]
Is it cause they like my G-Maps walk? [G-Maps walk]

Is it cuz they like my G-Maps talk? G-Maps talk]
Is it cuz they like my hand-traced SHPs? [hand-traced SHPs]
Is it cuz they like my ESRI ways?
Wherever they is, they love it
And they just won't just check in me


I handles my load don't rush me
Just relax; address API be free
I’ll track yo place (yo place), when you running
I got that mad geodesey
You know my routes resolve (resolve), stop fronting
Or I'll load my alternate map sheets
