"Python Thing"

sick of perl, real sick of perl
need something clean in my script-heavy world
git pull and i see dot py's
traversin' lists in only one line
sittin back with these keys at my hand
pip'n PyPI 'stead of CPAN
whitespace on my mind every minute
init my repos and you always in it, yo

it's such a python thing,
python thing, a python thing

and even though my code's fly,
i give my ifs space and use single trys,
actin like pythonistas
dont even try to front, y'all coffee scipt barristas
console telling me that she want ASCII,
I say 'I dunno' and raise Exception as e:
and when we do hackathons
we go on and on and on and on and on and
Sicker than Van Rossom
can I script lines?
well you know I git mine.
building code round simple args
breaking complex tasks into simple parts, yo

it's such a python thing,
python thing, a python thing
