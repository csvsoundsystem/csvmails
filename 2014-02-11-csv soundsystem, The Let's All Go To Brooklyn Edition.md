This week we'll be meeting today (tuesday) at 7pm at a new location, 61 Local in Cobble Hill. Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/61-local-brooklyn

You can grab the FG subways to Bergen Street.

We are switching away from Whynot Coffee because they now have music in the Jazz Room (it took us by surprise) and a cover. We're hoping 61 Local isn't too far out of people's way. We've been thinking about moving it here for some time, though, since it has a lot of space, reliable WiFi, and more actual food options than the other places. If it doesn't work, though, send us an email to this address and let us know.

Join us, won't you?

I tried really hard to come up with a good song this week but it wasn't quite up to our standards. To make up for it, here's the YouTube search results page for "Werner Herzog reads" https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=werner%20herzog%20reads&sm=3
