If you're new to the list and these poem filled emails aren't all that clear in terms of itinerary, csv soundsystem is a Wednesday thing where you can bring your laptop and work on something you've been meaning to make some progress on while hanging out with people doing the same. Sometimes people work together on projects but there are no rules. 

In news announcements, one project that's come out of the meetup just got a Knight-Mozilla code sprint grant to build an API for US treasury data (http://dansinker.com/post/49856260511/opennews-code-sprints-do-some-spring-cleaning-on-data). So this week I imagine some folks will be working on that.

We also send a programming- / journalism-themed riff on a song or poem along with this weekly reminder.

This week: Histomania

So representative, not representative no
Distribution all distorted yet
Darling, I'm skewed left and lonely
When with the Poisson only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, log of it, do let, do let, do

Let's go slowly Bernoulli
Different from another coin-toss on your favorite silver dollar
This flip's pure randomness only, that's in the theory only
No, I gotta pick something else
These days a point comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes

Histomania
Think negative and see it grow
Like a binom- like a binomial
It's fairly easily extended
It's not hard to bin them all
From the peaks to the valleys
