This week, the inimitable Carl Martin Burch will be hosting csv. In lieu of a song, we suggest you watch this seven minute film "Begone Dull Care" by Norman McLaren (1949). He was an animator and film maker at the National Film Board of Canada, which continues to put out interesting work today. He often scratched or painted directly on the film or into the soundtrack. Hope you like it.
