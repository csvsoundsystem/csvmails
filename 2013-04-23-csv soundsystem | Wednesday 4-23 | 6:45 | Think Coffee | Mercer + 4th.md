Stopping by CSV on a Busy Evening

Whose code this is I think I know.
His work is on another website, though;
He will not see me clone his repo,
To watch my Highcharts scale new highs.

My little laptop must think it queer
To commit new code with a deadline so near
Between the evening news and morning shows
The most productive hours of the night.

He gives his monitor a flicker
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the tap-tap-tap
Of gentle keyboard and springy mousepad.

The repo is lovely, well-organized and well, needs documentation,
But I have promises to keep,
And lines of code to go before I sleep,
And lines of code to go before I sleep.

Join us, wonâ€™t you?
