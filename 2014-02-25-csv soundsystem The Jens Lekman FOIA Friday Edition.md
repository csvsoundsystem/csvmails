We'll be meeting today (tuesday) at 6:45pm in the downstairs Jazz Room at Whynot Coffee & Wine in the West Village. Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whynot-coffee-and-wine-new-york

They have two locations so be careful not to end up in the east village.

Join us, won't you?

This week's song is a Jens Lekman classic about an imagined scene between me (Michael) and Cezary deciding to go through his FOIA folder (filled with both responses and drafts of requests not yet sent) on a FOIA Friday (a weekly exercise in keeping up with requests). In the second verse, we decide to automate our requests to more systematically cover the departments we're interested in. The entire process, filled with redactions and trumped up fees leaves us dispirited and questioning the role of government. We don't have a good answer to the question of what the ideal government is or should be, but we know what it isn't.

Hey Cezary, do you still have your folder
That old hunker's golden
How about we dig in to our chin, up and down writings
Highlight all questions of special whirls
I want to know if they redacted in haste
Do you like responses or requests?
The go-forth or the grand-get?
Don't rollover just yet
Look to the left, there's a trumped-up fine on my knee
And to my right, a zealous pen crossing out the precious sheet

I don't know what gov is,
But I know what it isn't.
I don't know what gov is,
But I know what it isn't.

So let's get'em buried
(Ah-hah)
I'm serious
But with the help of a microchip
I'm always liked the idea of it
A silicon chip isn't shy about its repititions of writ
How it doesn't apologize or sensationalize
All the rules and ideas we fill requests with.
Hey do you want to let go of this demand?
No I want it to expand
It must be packed with loan info on students
Clutching their debts as if they let go
Their feet would lift from the ground and ascend

I don't know what gov is,
But I know what it isn't.
I dont't know what gov is,
But I know what it isn't.

I know what gov isn't.
I know what gov isn't.
I know what gov isn't.
I know what gov isn't.
