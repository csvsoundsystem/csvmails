We'll be at Think Coffee, Mercer + 4th starting at 7:30 tomorrow (Tuesday the 15th). 

To commemorate government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis, here's Huey Lewis and the News with "The Power of Gov"

######
The power of gov is a curious sitch
Make a one man poor, make another man rich
grind society into dystopic dust
More than the ceiling, that’s the power of gov 
Tougher than Boehner, rich like Cruz
Stronger and harder than unregulated booze
Make the fed rate low, raise the money supply
Power of gov, keeps you wondering why
It’s not just money, it’s not just a bank,
can’t cut the deficit to mend the state
It’s strong and it’s sudden and it’s cruel sometimes 
But it might just save your life 
That’s the power of gov
That’s the power of gov
